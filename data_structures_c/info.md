This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms in C.
These implementations were created as part of my learning for the Massive 
Open Online Course (MOOC) called "C Programming for Everybody" by Dr. Chuck Severance.

Please note that while some function headers and code may have been provided as part of 
the course materials, I've labeled the parts of the implementations are my own work--
occasionally with the help of JetBrains AI assistant.
